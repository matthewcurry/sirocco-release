asgsvc/join.ae: In function ‘__ae_worker_bootstrap_from_list’:
asgsvc/join.ae:398:59: error: ‘struct
bootstrap_from_list_return_params’ has no member named
‘tryadd_398_9_ret’

This happens (at least) when the function has a void return type, but
you attempt to assign its return value.

The following test fails because the declaration of the variable
follows the conditional. Declaring the variable at the beginning of
the file fixes this. In general, it's always a good idea to have
variable declarations at the top of functions, without assignments.

[mlcurry@localhost bin]$ cat test.ae
#include <aesop/aesop.h>

void
test(void)
{
	if (1 > 0) {
		printf("Hello.\n");
	}
	int i;
	return;
}

__blocking int
aemain(int argc, char **argv)
{
	test();
	return 0;
}

aesop_main_set(aemain);

[mlcurry@localhost bin]$ ./aecc test.ae
