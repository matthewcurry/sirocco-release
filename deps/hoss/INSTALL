Thanks to Argonne, as their examples form the bulk of autotools
support here.

Known issues:
- CPPFLAGS does not work. Use CFLAGS instead.
- You will get warnings from system headers, notably those from
  -Wmissing-prototypes.
- Everything in this package will compile with -D_BSD_SOURCE and
  -DDB_DBM_HSEARCH=0. The AESOP compile rules don't listen to
  -per-target flags.

Berkeley DB Snapshot support
---
Please use one of the following, in order of preference:

- Use the libdb-6.1.20 development package from your distribution, or
  compile your own.
- Compile your own libdb-6.1.19 with the following patch:
     patch <your-db-sources>/src/btree/bt_search.c \
     <your-hoss-path>/maint/db-6.1.19-snapshot-isolation-2739213.diff
  Note that Aesop should configured/built against this libdb for HOSS
  to benefit from the patch. Then use the
  --enable-bdb-snapshot-isolation to configure HOSS.
- Use the libdb-5.1 (or greater) development package from your
  distribution. Note that certain workloads will cause errors,
  specifically that BDB has run out of locks.
