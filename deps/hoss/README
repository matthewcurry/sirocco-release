Note:

- Deferred READs still have I/O done within the context of a
  transaction. One implementation strategy is to copy all affected
  intervals from the IDB while the transaction is running, and perform
  the I/O after the transaction has committed. There is a problem with
  this strategy: After the transaction has committed, it is possible
  for another process to intervene and punch a region that is
  scheduled for read. This could be seriously difficult.
