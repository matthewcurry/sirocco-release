Recordstore
===========

Recordstore is an implementation of high-performance opaque blob
storage. It was developed at [Argonne National Laboratory (ANL)][anl]
by members of the [Mathematics and Computer Science (MCS)][mcs] group
for the [Triton][triton] project, as well as the [Sirocco] [sirocco]
project at [Sandia National Laboratories (SNL)][snl].

It depends on AESOP, a set of extensions to the C programming language
to enable event-driven programs. [More information is available from
ANL.][aesop]

Currently, the HEAD of this repository builds against an as-yet
unreleased version of AESOP. To build against AESOP 0.2.1, please use
commit 1110f6f.
