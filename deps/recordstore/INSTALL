Example configure, build, and install commands:

    ./prepare.sh

    mkdir build

    cd build

    ../configure --prefix=/home/pcarns/working/asg/recordstore/install \
    PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/home/pcarns/working/aesop/install/lib/pkgconfig:/home/pcarns/working/c-utils/install/lib/pkgconfig
    \
    CFLAGS="-g -fno-diagnostics-show-caret -fno-omit-frame-pointer"

    make

    make check

    make install

Explanation of configure options:

- The PKG_CONFIG_PATH must include paths to aesop and c-utils dependencies
  unless they are already available in the default system locations.
- "-fno-diagnostics-show-caret" is a workaround to avoid superfluous warning
  text from newer gcc compilers.
- "-g -fno-omit-frame-pointer" are debugging options, can be replaced with
  "-O3" or similar if building for performance testing
