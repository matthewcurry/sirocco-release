INSTALLATION NOTES

This distribution was generated with GNU AutoTools, meaning that it supports
the full range of options typically offered.

Note that this release has only been tested when statically linked.

Installation will use the Autotools default user library and header
directories on your system.

Basic installation:

  ./configure
  make install

To enable debug messaging (perhaps to help the developers), instead do:

  ./configure CFLAGS="-DSSMPP_OUT_VVERBOSE"
  make install
