/** \mainpage
 * \section Introduction
 * Tommy is a C library of hashtables and tries designed to store objects with high performance.
 *
 * It's <b>faster</b> than all the similar libraries like
 * <a href="http://www.canonware.com/rb/">rbtree</a>,
 * <a href="http://judy.sourceforge.net/">judy</a>,
 * <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-sparsehash/">goodledensehash</a>,
 * <a href="http://attractivechaos.awardspace.com/">khash</a>,
 * <a href="http://uthash.sourceforge.net/">uthash</a>,
 * <a href="http://www.nedprod.com/programs/portable/nedtries/">nedtrie</a> and others.
 *
 * The data structures provided are:
 *
 * - ::tommy_list - A double linked list.
 * - ::tommy_array - A linear array. It doesn't fragment the heap.
 * - ::tommy_hashtable - A fixed size chained hashtable.
 * - ::tommy_hashdyn - A dynamic chained hashtable.
 * - ::tommy_hashlin - A linear chained hashtable. It doesn't have the
 * problem of the delay when resizing and it doesn't fragment
 * the heap.
 * - ::tommy_trie - A trie optimized for cache utilization.
 * - ::tommy_trie_inplace - A trie completely inplace.
 *
 * The most interesting are ::tommy_hashlin, ::tommy_trie and ::tommy_trie_inplace.
 *
 * Tommy is released with a \ref license "2-clause BSD license".
 *
 * The official site of TommyDS is <a href="http://tommyds.sourceforge.net/">http://tommyds.sourceforge.net/</a>,
 *
 * \section Use
 *
 * All the data structures share the same interface that needs to embedded in the object to store
 * a node of type ::tommy_node.
 *
 * Inside this node is stored a pointer to the object itself in the tommy_node::data field,
 * and the key used to identify the object in the tommy_node::key field.
 *
 * \code
 * struct object {
 *     tommy_node node;
 *     // other fields
 *     int value;
 * };
 * \endcode
 *
 * To insert an object you have to provide the address of the embedded node, the address of the
 * object and the value of the key.
 * \code
 * struct object* obj = malloc(sizeof(struct object));
 *
 * tommy_trie_insert(..., &obj->node, obj, obj->value);
 * \endcode
 *
 * To search an object you have to provide the key and call the search function.
 * \code
 * struct object* obj = tommy_trie_search(..., value_to_find);
 * if (!obj) {
 *   // not found
 * } else {
 *   // found
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * To access all the objects with the same keys you have to iterate over the bucket
 * assigned at the specified key.
 * \code
 * tommy_trie_node* i = tommy_trie_bucket(..., value_to_find);
 *
 * while (i) {
 *     struct object* obj = i->data; // gets the object pointer
 *
 *     printf("%d\n", obj->value); // process the object
 *
 *     i = i->next; // goes to the next element
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * To remove an object you have to provide the key and call the remove function.
 * \code
 * struct object* obj = tommy_trie_remove(..., value);
 * if (obj) {
 *     free(obj); // frees the object allocated memory
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * Dealing with hashtables, instead of the key, you have to provide the hash value of the object,
 * and a compare function able to differentiate objects with the same hash value.
 *
 * To compute the hash value, you can use the generic tommy_hash() function, or the
 * specialized integer hash function tommy_inthash_u32().
 *
 * \section Performance
 * Here you can see some timings compared to other common implementations in <i>Hit</i>
 * and <i>Change</i> performance. Hit is searching an object with success, and Change is searching, removing
 * and reinsert it with a different key value.
 *
 * Times are expressed in nanoseconds for element, so <b>lower is better</b>.
 *
 * A complete analysis is available in the \ref benchmark page.

 *
 * \section Features
 *
 * Tommy is 100% portable in all the platforms and operating systems.
 *
 * Tommy containers support multiple elemements with the same key.
 *
 * \section Limitations
 *
 * Tommy is not thread safe. You have always to provide thread safety using
 * locks before calling any Tommy functions.
 *
 * Tommy doesn't provide iterators over the implicit order defined by the data
 * structures. To iterate on elements you must insert them also into a ::tommy_list,
 * and use the list as iterator. See the \ref multiindex example for more details.
 * Note that this is a real limitation only for ::tommy_trie, as it's the only
 * data structure defining an useable order.
 *
 * Tommy doesn't provide an error reporting mechanism for a malloc() failure.
 * You have to provide it redefining malloc() if you expect it to fail.
 *
 * Tommy assumes to never have more than 2^32 elements in a container.
 *
 * \page benchmark Tommy Benchmarks
 *
 * To evaluate Tommy performances, an extensive benchmark was done,
 * comparing it to the best hashtable and trie libraries available.
 *
 * \section thebenchmark The Benchmark
 *
 * The benchmark consists in storing a set of N pointers to objects and
 * searching them using an integer key.
 *
 * It's different than the simpler case of mapping integers to integers,
 * as pointers to objects are also dereferenced resulting in additional cache
 * misses. This benchmark favorites implementations that store information in the
 * objects itself, as the additional cache misses are already implicit.
 *
 * The test dones are:
 *  - <b>Insert</b> Insert all the objects starting with an empty container.
 *  - <b>Hit</b> Find with success all the objects and derefence them.
 *  - <b>Miss</b> Find with failure all the objects.
 *  - <b>Change</b> Find and remove one object and reinsert it with a different key, repeated for all the objects.
 *  - <b>Remove</b> Remove all the objects end dereference them.
 *
 * The <i>Hit</i>, <i>Miss</i> and <i>Change</i> tests operate always with N
 * objects in the containers.
 * The <i>Insert</i> test starts with an empty container, and the <i>Remove</i>
 * test ends with an empty container.
 * The objects are always deferenced, as we are supposing to use them. This
 * happens even in the remove case, as we are supposing to deallocate them.
 *
 * The tests are repeated using keys in <i>Random</i> order and then in <i>Forward</i> order.
 * The random order favorites hashtables, as the hash function already randomizes the key. 
 * The forward order favorites tries and trees as they use the key directly and they have a
 * cache advantage on using consecutive keys.
 * Usually real uses case are in between, where the random one is the
 * worst case.
 *
 * All the objects are preallocated in the heap, and this allocation time is not
 * included in the test.
 *
 * The objects contain an integer <i>value</i> field used for consistency checks, an unused
 * <i>payload</i> field of 16 bytes, and any other data required by the data
 * structure.
 *
 * The objects are identified and stored using integers and unique <i>keys</i>.
 * The key domain used is <strong>dense</strong>, and it's defined by the set
 * of N even numbers starting from 0x80000000 to 0x80000000+2*N.
 *
 * The use of even numbers allows to have missing numbers inside the domain for
 * the <i>Miss</i> and <i>Change</i> tests.
 * Using missing numbers at the corners of the domain would have favorited tries
 * and trees as they implicitely keep track of the maximum and minimum value inserted.
 *
 * The use of the 0x80000000 base, allow to test a key domain not necessarily
 * starting at 0. Using a 0 base would have favorited some tries managing it as a special case.
 *
 * The following data structures are tested:
 *  - ::tommy_hashtable - Fixed size chained hashtable.
 *  - ::tommy_hashdyn - Dynamic chained hashtable.
 *  - ::tommy_hashlin - Linear chained hashtable.
 *  - ::tommy_trie - Trie optimized for cache usage.
 *  - ::tommy_trie_inplace - Trie completely inplace.

 *
 * \section result Results
 *
 * The most significative tests depend on your data usage model, but if in doubt,
 * you should mostly look at <i>Random Hit</i> and <i>Random Change</i>.
 *
 * They are valuated the most significatives, because operating always with N elements
 * in the data structure and with a random pattern, they mostly mimic real conditions.
 *
 * <img src="def/img_random_hit.png"/>
 *
 * In the <i>Random Hit</i> graph you can see a vertical split at the 100.000 elements limit.
 * Before this limit the cache of modern processor is able to contains most of the data, and it allow a very fast access with the most of data structure.
 * After this limit, the number of cache misses is the dominant factor, and the curve depends mainly on the number of cache
 * miss required to reach the object.
 *
 * For rbtree and nedtrie, it's log2(N) as they have two branches on each node, log4(N) for ::tommy_trie_inplace, log8(N) for ::tommy_trie and 1 for hashtables.
 * For ::tommy_trie_inplace and ::tommy_trie you can change the slope configuring a different number of branches for node.
 *
 * <img src="def/img_random_change.png"/>
 *
 * The <i>Random Change</i> graph confirms the vertical split at the 100.000 elements limit.
 * It also show that hashtables are almost unbeatable with a random access.
 *
 * \section random Random order
 * Here you can see the whole <i>Random</i> test results in different platforms.
 *
 * In <i>Random</i> tests hashtables are almost always winning, seconds are
 * tries, and as last trees.
 *  
 * The best choices are ::tommy_hashlin, and goodledensehash, with
 * ::tommy_hashlin having the advantage to be real-time friendly and not
 * increasing the heap fragmentation.

 * \section forward Forward order
 * Here you can see the whole <i>Forward</i> tests results in different platforms.
 *
 * In <i>Forward</i> tests tries are the winners. Hashtables are competitive
 * until the cache limit, then they lose against tries. Trees are the slowest.
 *  
 * The best choices are ::tommy_trie and ::tommy_trie_inplace, where ::tommy_trie is
 * a bit faster, and ::tommy_trie_inplace doesn't require a custom allocator.
 *
 * Note that also hashtables are faster in forward order than random. This may
 * seem a bit surprising as the hash function randomizes the access even with
 * consecutive keys. This happens because the objects are allocated in consecutive
 * memory, and accessing them in order, improves the cache utilization, even if
 * the hashed key is random.
 *
 * Note also that you can easily get hashtables to reach tries performance tweaking
 * the hash function to put near keys accessed nearby. For example, in the benchmark
 * use something like:
 * \code
 * #define hash(v) tommy_inthash32(v & ~0xF) + (v & 0xF)
 * \endcode

 * \section notes Notes
 * 
 * Here some notes about the data structure tested not part of Tommy.
 * 
 * \subsection cgoogledensehash Google C sparsehash and densehash
 * It's the C implementation located in the experimental/ directory of the googlesparsehash archive.
 * It has very bad performances in the <i>Change</i> test for some N values.
 * See for example this <a href="other/cgoogledensehash_problem.png">graph</a> with a lot of spikes.
 * The C++ version doesn't suffer of this problem.
 * 
 * \subsection googledensehash Google C++ densehash
 * It doesn't release memory on deletion.
 * To avoid an unfair advantage in the <i>Remove</i> test, we force a periodic
 * resize calling resize(0) after any deallocation.
 * The resize is executed when the load factor is lower than 20%.
 * 
 * \subsection khash khash
 * It doesn't release memory on deletion. This gives an unfair advantage on the <i>Remove</i> test.
 * 
 * \subsection judy Judy
 * Sometimes it has bad performances in some specific platform
 * and for some specific input data size.
 * This makes difficult to predict the performance, as it is usually good until
 * you get one of these cases.
 * See for example this <a href="other/judy_problem.png">graph</a> with a big replicable spike at 50.000 elements.
 * 
 * \subsection nedtrie nedtrie
 * I've found a crash bug when inserting keys with the 0 value.
 * The <a href="https://github.com/ned14/nedtries/commit/21039696f27db4ffac70a82f89dc5d00ae74b332">fix</a> of this issue is now in the nedtries github.
 * We do not use the C++ implementation as it doesn't compile with gcc 4.4.3.
 *
 * \page multiindex Tommy Multi Indexing
 *
 * Tommy doesn't provide iterators support to iterate over all the elements inside
 * a data structure. To do that you have to manually insert any objects also in a
 * ::tommy_list, and use the list as iterator.
 *
 * This technique allows to keep track of the insertion order with the list,
 * and provide more search possibilities using different data structures for
 * different search keys.
 *
 * See the next example, for an object that is inserted in a ::tommy_list, and in
 * two ::tommy_trie using different keys.
 *
 * \code
 * struct object {
 *     tommy_node list_node; // node for the list
 *     tommy_node trie_node_0; // node for the first trie
 *     tommy_node trie_node_1; // node for the second trie
 *     // other fields
 *     int value_0;
 *     int value_1;
 * };
 *
 * tommy_allocator alloc;
 * tommy_trie trie_0;
 * tommy_trie trie_1;
 * tommy_list list;
 *
 * // initializes the allocator, the tries and the list
 * tommy_allocator_init(&alloc, TOMMY_TRIE_BLOCK_SIZE, TOMMY_TRIE_BLOCK_SIZE);
 * tommy_trie_init(&trie_0, &alloc);
 * tommy_trie_init(&trie_1, &alloc);
 * tommy_list_init(&list);
 *
 * ...
 *
 * // inserts an object
 * struct object* obj = ...
 * tommy_trie_insert(&trie_0, &obj->trie_node_0, obj, obj->value0); // inserts in the first trie
 * tommy_trie_insert(&trie_1, &obj->trie_node_1, obj, obj->value1); // inserts in the second trie
 * tommy_list_insert_tail(&list, &obj->list_node, obj); // inserts in the list
 *
 * ...
 *
 * // searches an object and delete it
 * struct object* obj = tommy_trie_search(&trie_1, value1_to_find);
 * if (obj) {
 *     // if found removes all the references
 *     tommy_trie_remove_existing(&trie_0, &obj->trie_node_0);
 *     tommy_trie_remove_existing(&trie_1, &obj->trie_node_1);
 *     tommy_list_remove_existing(&list, &obj->list_node);
 * }
 *
 * ...
 *
 * // iterates over all the elements using the list, and delete them
 * tommy_node* i = tommy_list_head(&list);
 * while (i) {
 *     tommy_node* i_next = i->next; // saves the next element before freeing
 *
 *     // removes all the references
 *     tommy_trie_remove_existing(&trie_0, &obj->trie_node_0);
 *     tommy_trie_remove_existing(&trie_1, &obj->trie_node_1);
 *     tommy_list_remove_existing(&list, &obj->list_node);
 *
 *     free(i->data); // frees the object allocated memory
 *
 *     i = i_next; // goes to the next element
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * \page design Tommy Design
 *
 * Tommy is mainly designed to provide high performance, but also much care was
 * given in the definition of an useable API. In some case, even at the cost of
 * some efficency.
 *
 * \section datapointer Data pointer
 * The tommy_node::data field is present only to provide a simpler API.
 *
 * A more memory conservative approach is to do not store this pointer, and
 * computing it from the node pointer every time considering that they are
 * always at a constant offset.
 *
 * See for example the Linux Kernel declaration of container_of() at
 * http://lxr.linux.no/#linux+v2.6.37/include/linux/kernel.h#L526
 *
 * Although, it would have required more complexity for the user to require
 * a manual conversion from a node to the object containing the node.
 *
 * \section zero_list Zero terminated next list
 * The half 0 terminated format of ::tommy_list is present only to provide
 * a forward iterator terminating in 0.
 *
 * A more efficient approach is to use a double circular list, as operating on
 * nodes in a circular list doesn't requires to manage the special terminating
 * case.
 *
 * Although, it would have required too much complexity at the user for a simple
 * iteration.
 *
 * \section double_linked Double linked list for collisions
 * The linked list used for collision is a double linked list to allow
 * insertion of elements at the end of the list to keep the insertion order
 * of equal elements.
 *
 * A more memory conservative approach is to use a single linked list,
 * inserting elements only at the start of the list.
 * On the other hand, with with a double linked list we can concatenate
 * two lists in constant time, as using the previous circular element we
 * can get a tail pointer.
