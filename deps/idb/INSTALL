Thanks to Argonne, as their examples form the bulk of autotools
support here.

Known issues:
- CPPFLAGS does not work. Use CFLAGS instead.
- You will get warnings from system headers, notably those from
  -Wmissing-prototypes.
- Everything in this package will compile with -D_BSD_SOURCE and
  -DDB_DBM_HSEARCH=0. The AESOP compile rules don't listen to
  -per-target flags.
