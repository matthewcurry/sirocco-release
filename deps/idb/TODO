Using the Aesop interface to IDB seems to be prone to deadlock, at
least with the following command line:

aeidb -dL -M$((1024*1024*1024)) -i50 -p8 100000

idb.c needs to be modified such that deadlocks can be recovered from
gracefully.

Running without deadlock detection never locked up aeidb workloads. Is
it possible we're running the deadlock detection too often?
