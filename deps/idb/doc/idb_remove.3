.SH NAME
idb_remove \- Remove an interval into an IDB
.SH LIBRARY
The Interval Database Library (libidb, -lidb or -laeidb)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <idb.h>

.BI "int"
.BI "idb_remove(IDBX " idbx ", IDB " idb ", struct idb_interval " *iv ");"

.B #include <aeidb.hae>

.BI "__blocking int"
.BI "aeidb_remove(IDBX " idbx ", IDB "idb ", struct idb_interval " *iv ");"
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR idb_remove ()
function removes
.I iv
from
.I idb
as part of
.I idbx.
Upon successful completion, the range covered by
.I iv
will be an empty contiguous region within the context of
.I idbx,
with overlapping intervals truncated.
.BR aeidb_remove
is an Aesop variant that may call blocking functions internally,
causing execution to move to another pbranch when available.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.I idb_remove
returns 0 on success, or an error code from
.B <errno.h>.
BerkeleyDB reserves the right to return practically any error code it
wishes, so IDB functions will as well. The most likely/well-defined
error codes are:
.TP
.B EDOM
The interval's range falls outside of values expressable with
.I idb_off_t
.TP
.B EPERM
.I idb
is read-only.
.TP
.B ENOTRECOVERABLE
The Berkeley DB state has become corrupt. To fix, IDB must be shut
down and restarted.
.TP
.B ENOMEM
There was insufficient memory available to complete the request.
.TP
.B ENOSPC
The Berkeley DB btree structure for
.I idb
has reached maximum depth.

No storage space available.
.SH BUGS
.\".IP \(bu 3
Parallel updates to a single IDB are problematic for several
reasons. It is best to serialize writes to a given IDB, including not
opening a new transaction until the old one is finished. Concurrent
reads, and reads in parallel with a single write, are OK.
