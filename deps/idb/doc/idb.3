.SH NAME
IDB - The Interval Database Library

.SH DESCRIPTION
The Interval Database (IDB) library manages an index of
non-overlapping intervals, as well as ancilliary data including update
IDs, record lengths, log offsets, and flags. While not a full-featured
database, the IDB is mainly useful for managing log-structured and
byte-granular storage.

.SH SEE ALSO
idb_init(3), idb_open(3), idb_close(3), idb_begin(3), idb_end(3), idb_insert(3), idb_remove(3), idb_stab(3)
