.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR idb_init ()
function initializes the IDB library.
.B idb_init ()
may be called multiple times, and must be followed by an equal number of calls to
.B idb_fini ().
Upon successful completion, all other IDB functions may be called.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.I idb_init
returns 0 on success, or an error code from
.B <errno.h>.
BerkeleyDB reserves the right to return practically any error code it
wishes, so IDB functions will as well. The most likely/well defined
error codes are:

down and restarted.
