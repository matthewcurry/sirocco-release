BUILDING
========

0. This software depends on the Aesop compiler, version 0.2.1. To
   install in the project directory, run ./install-aesop.sh. To only
   download the materials required to install offline, run
   ./install-aesop.sh --no-build, then at the offline machine run
   ./install-aesop.sh.

1. Several packages were designed to be distributed independently, but
   are bundled with this release. To install them, run
   ./install-deps.sh. Unlike the previous step, this does not depend
   on an internet connection.

2. Run make.

NOTABLE FILES
=============
server/server  - The storage server executable.

include/asg.h  - The ASG object storage API, detailed in Karakoyunlu et
                 al., "Toward a unified object storage foundation for
                 scalable storage systems," Cluster 2013. aasg.h also
                 has support structures defined.

sos/randtest.c
sos/testit.c   - Example clients that use the ASG API to work with
                 storage.

COMPILING A CLIENT
==================
To compile a client using the ASG API, use the following incantantions:

export LDLIBS="-lsxm -lsos -lssmptcp -lssm -lpthread -lrt"
export LDFLAGS="-L${PATH_TO_REPO}/lib"
export CPPFLAGS="-I${PATH_TO_REPO}/include"
make testit
